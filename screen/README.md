Install
-----------
ln -sf $(pwd)/screenrc ${HOME}/.screenrc

Description
-----------
This is my GNU .screenrc file and a simple something to push it to $HOME.

Hopefully large files with all their comments and crap do not take up much screen memory. I left a lot of the cruft as I tweaked the visuals.

My changelog
----------
####2013-08-29

* Change the key-binding for next/prev screen to Ctrl-F11 & Ctrl-F12.  
This setting may not work in some ssh client(e.g. PuTTY). You can uncomment correct `BINDKEY` part in `.screenrc` by yourself.
* Customize the hardstatus bar, adding a background color on the title of current screen window.
